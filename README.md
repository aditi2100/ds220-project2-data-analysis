## **Problem Space**  
### **What?**  
This project analyzes Netflix’s global catalog of movies and TV shows using a structured data-driven approach. It examines patterns in content production, genre distribution, growth over time, and country-level contributions.

### **Why?**  
As streaming platforms continue to dominate the entertainment industry, understanding how Netflix curates and expands its catalog is essential. This analysis helps uncover trends in content availability, regional diversity, and viewing options. Such insights can guide strategic decisions, academic research, and discussions around global media consumption.

### **Who Benefits?**  
- Viewers seeking to understand available content and trends   
- Media analysts examining streaming market behavior   
- Entertainment industry professionals identifying production and distribution patterns   
- Students & researchers analyzing real-world data for learning   
- Content creators looking for opportunities based on genre and regional demand   

### **Where & When?**  
The analysis uses Netflix’s internationally available dataset, containing titles released globally up to 2021. It reflects worldwide content trends rather than region-specific variations.  

---

## **📜Questions to Address**
1. How many titles on Netflix are Movies vs TV Shows?  
2. How many titles were added each year?  
3. Which countries produce the most content?  
4. What are the most popular genres?  
5. How have release trends changed over time?  
6. Are Netflix titles single-genre or multi-genre?

## 🫧Data Cleaning Performed

Key preprocessing steps included:

- Converting `date_added` into datetime format  
- Extracting `added_year` and `added_month`  
- Handling missing values in `country`, `director`, and `listed_in`  
- Splitting multi-genre fields  
- Parsing and converting `duration` values  
- Creating a `num_genres` feature  
- Standardizing column names (lowercase, underscore format)
